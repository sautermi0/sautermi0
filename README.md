Hey there, I'm Michael ;-) 

I've been with SAP since 2012, and currently work on reshaping the ABAP Dictionary for the future. I'm also active as a trainer for Agile Software Engineering, and a member of the Decision Board for the CleanABAP guide.

Views, comments and repositories on this profile are my own, not SAP's.
